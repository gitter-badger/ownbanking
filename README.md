# OwnBanking, Integration without Intermediaries

## Motivation

Existing aggregators ask you to trust them _unconditionally_.
They want your bank credentials to impersonate you using web scrapers,
and most of them profit from selling your data.

Many financial institutions provide secure Open APIs to access your
accounts and allow you to safely grant read-only permissions to
applications.

OwnBanking is a _progressive web app_ that runs directly on your browser
and stores everything in there, on your mobile device, laptop or, desktop.

OwnBanking uses exclusively APIs to fetch the data so you are in complete
control.

### Full Disclosure

OwnBanking was born out of my frustration with existing aggregators, but
also as an _excuse_ to learn:

1. Progressive Web Apps
2. webpack
3. es2015
4. oauth2
5. and, get hands-on experience with existing APIs to improve those I create for other projects
